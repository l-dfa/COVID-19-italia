Time trend of Coronavirus Covid-19 in Italy
============================================

*Data updated at ${UPDATED}*.

This article reports the temporal trend of the data of the Italian Ministry of Health
released by the Civil Protection,
related to the COVID-19 epidemic that has hit Italy since February 2020.

Graphical analysis
-------------------

Below is a graph composed of two zones. The upper zone draws the time series of 
*cumulative* data relating to the epidemic.
Here I show, day by day:

* the numbers of infected cases (positive);
* those, unfortunately, deceased;
* the healed;
* and, finally, the total numeber of cases: infected+healed+deceased.

The lower area graphically shows, day by day, the trend of the
variation of positive cases. The abscissas of the zones are aligned. Thereby
it is immediate to compare the trend of the slope of the line of positive cases
present in the upper area, with the difference of the cases, reported in the 
inferior area.

Hereafter the numbers for the last day detected. The columns indicate [#]_:

  date,overall hospit.,quarantine at home,positives,change of positives,new positives,healed,deceased,overall cases
  
* *date*, the date of the day;
* *overall hospit.*, the number of positive cases hospitalized;
* *quarantine at home*, the number of positive cases in home isolation,
  with mild or no symptoms;
* *positives*, the sum of the positive cases: hospitalized+quarantine;
* *change of positives*, the variation of the sum of the positive cases
  between the current and the previous date; this is not a cumulative data;
* *new positives*, the new positive cases at the current date; this is not
  a cumulative datum;
* *healed*, the number of patients healed;
* *deceased*, the number of deceased patients;
* *overall cases*, the total number of cases: positive+healed+deceased.

Instead, the following graph shows the time trend od *total cases* for
the six most hitted regions.

To have a general idea about the geographical distribution of the virus,
the following histogram shows the total cases for every region.

Finally, below I report the temporal trend of *new daily cases* regarding the
overall country.

This chart is the one checked by ISS experts to understand the trend
infection. And based on this they tell us that we have passed the *peak*
of the contagions. What does this statement mean? The daily number of new ones
contagion is the *speed* of spread of the infection. For infections
it is observed that the diffusion speed has a trend that recalls that presented
from this graph, taken from `this wikipedia article <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandemic>`_:

.. image::  https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/90/Community_mitigation_%28cropped%29.jpg
   :height: 451 px
   :width:  800 px
   :align: center
   :alt:   pandemic
   :name:  pandemic
   
Having exceeded the peak means having overtaken the maximum of the graph, and
proceed towards ever lower diffusion rates.

In the previous graph we see the theoretical effect
of containment, which allows to postpone the peak and to lower it:
the aim is not to decrease the number of affected people [#]_, but to dilute the time
expansion to prevent healthcare facilities from going into crisis.

Unfortunately, the actual course of an infection is quite different from that
of a theoretical curve, and it is influenced by many factors. First among all
the possibility of contrasting the diffusion. And that's what we're looking at
in our real trend of *new daily cases*. It is quite difficult to see a similarity
with the curve above.
Above all, the trend of cases after the peak does not seem to decrease
as indicated by the theoretical model. Rather, there is the sensation of assisting
at a very slow decrease with a linear trend.

Some remarks
---------------------

*[April 12, 2020]*. Government continues to tell us that things are constantly
improving. The fact is that they tend to present *best* data from time to time. 
Once upon a time it is the low number of death. The day after a lesser gain
of positives. And the next day, the decrease
of the hospitalized. This way of doing has the purpose of avoiding the spread of discouragement.
But in this way people lower their guard and they do not respect the
containment rules.

We can see the result in our charts. Meanwhile we reached the peak of new daily infections
(over 6500) on March 21, twenty days later we still have almost
4700 new cases of infection every day. The descent rate is very slow.

Let's face China. In that case one month after the start of the lockdown,
the curve of the total cases had definitely changed its shape, decreasing the
slope to clearly start the expected flattening. Flattening indicating
zero new infections.

In Italy, one month after the introduction of the lockdown, which took place on March 9,
the curve of total cases still points decidedly upwards. Obvious sign that
the measures in place are unable to block the spread of the virus
in a few weeks.

This observation also applies to the United Europe as a whole. With the difference
that Italy began the lockdown much earlier than the other EU countries.
Indeed, one month after the outbreak of the infection
in Europe, some of these countries do not have yet imposed the lockdown. So in theory now
we should be much better. Theory that I do not see come true in practice.

I think the keystone is to isolate asymptomatic positives.
In Italy we are not implementing a strong positive quarantine policy. While in
China these were removed from their families. Here this does not happen.
Consequently, a new positive in Italy almost certainly equates to contagion
of an entire family.

*[April 12, 2020 - end]*


*[March 30, 2020]*: **maybe** finally we can hope. Looking at the chart below,
we note that the variation of the positives (the bottom rectangle) is decreasing
for 9 days, except for a sudden single increase on March 25th. Statistically,
we can hope that the lockdown is finally producing effects
to contain the outbreak.

*[March 30, 2020 - end]*



*[March 18th 2020]* About *the national trend*, I feel the
need to remark the following fact. Various sources of information are
using the **general total of daily data** of the Ministry of Health
to account for the change in the epidemic.

This number indicates the **total** number of people
affected by the virus, adding three different groups: sick,
healed and deceased. This quantity give us an idea of ​​the overall impact of
phenomenon. It can only increase. And when all this ends, it will take on a fixed 
value: constant, equal to the maximum value reached. The slope of this curve
(i.e. its daily variation, used by many news media) tells us if
the speed with which the virus impacts the country as a whole decreases. But 
it is not the right indicator to measure the virulence of the infection.

The data relating to each of the aforementioned groups are precious. The analysis of each of these classes
tells us something
about how we are dealing with the epidemic. For example, observe how it varies
the number of people healed per day, after a few weeks, can tell us
how the therapies adopted are effective.

But the total of these three quantities is much more articulated, and if the analysis is not
pointig in the right direction, it gives us misleading indications.
Remember the concept of adding apples with pears,
who taught us in elementary school? It is just that.

To understand the progress of the infection, it is necessary to analyze the size of the
group formed by infected people, and only these. The healed and the deceased
are no longer infected. Both of these cases are *defeats* for the virus, which is not
more able to propagate using them as vectors.

The size of the group of infected people is the red line
in the upper box of the national trend. To observe the variation of the
slope of this curve is particularly important: it tells us the **speed**
of spreading the virus.

Even just the total number of infected people (note: not the total
of people affected: infected + healed + deceased) is complex to analyze.
Consider the fact that every day the other two classes (heale and deceased)
contribute to this measure: they subtract to the number of
infected. While the number of new positives adds up. The slope of the total
of infected people is the result of these three quantities, antagonistic to each other.

I find misleading the term *new_currently_positive* that Civil Protection 
uses in its data tables. In my data analysis I call this column
*change of positives* because it is the difference between the total of the positives of the day
and the total of the positives from the previous day.

The number of people joining the positive group for the first time,
also known as the *new currently positive*, can be calculated by adding to the
*changes of positives* the number of people who left the group: the people healed during the course
of the day and the deceased during the day. If you do this
operation, in this period there is a notable increase in new positives
compliance with the provisions of the Civil Protection.
